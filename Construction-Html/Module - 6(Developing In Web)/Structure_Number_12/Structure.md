# Web Structure 
Now we are in the last module. Here we will learn how to deal with the structure of web pages and how this organization is done.
## Illustrative Examples
**We will use Globloplay and G1 as an example to better understand what exactly this structure is, note:**

## Explanation
Note the following, within each of these images there is a separate block, where in this block there is a title, a link, navigation bar among other attributes and tags that we have already seen in previous modules. Inspecting each of them, this organization becomes clearer:

- **Upper Part(Anchors):** On the G1 page, we identified a separation of anchors in its upper part.

- **Content Part:** Again in G1, we noticed that in a single block we have a title and a paragraph.

- **Content Part(Images Round):** Now on Globloplay, we have a "collection of images" of the most popular programs along with a smaller title.

- **Bloom Part:** On this same screen at Globoplay, we analyze a search area with an input accompanied by an icon.

# Conclusion
In other words, we know that we have separate blocks. But why do we use them? Simple, for better organization and styling on the pages, making the process easier. Now, how do we make these blocks and differentiate them?
