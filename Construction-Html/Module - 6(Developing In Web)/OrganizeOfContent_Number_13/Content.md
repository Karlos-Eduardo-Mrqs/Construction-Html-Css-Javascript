# Web Page Content
In the previous folder (Estrutura_Número_12), we learned how to observe and interpret the blocks within Web pages. And now, we will make the main content and differentiate them, having three important parts, **Header, Content and Footer**.
## Header
The header is the top part of our website, where the navigation bar (set of anchors), account, support or contact us, etc. are located. Watch:

### Formatting in Html
**This entire part is called the header. We can use the tags ``<header> </header> and <nav> </nav>``**
```
<header> 
        Cabeçalho 
        <nav>
            <a href="#">Início</a>
            <a href="pagina-2.html">Página 2</a>
        </nav>
    </header>
```
## Content
Content is the central part of our website, containing all texts, images, anchors, titles and others.What is necessary to explain/talk about a topic that the user will read. Watch:

### Formatting in Html
**Note that we have numerous attributes and tags to make our content, the most "eye-catching for user interaction. We can use the tags ``<main></main> <section> </section> <div> </div> <aside> </aside> ``**
```
<main>
        <div>
            <section>
                <h1> Cabeçalho, Conteúdo e o Rodápe</h1>
                <p> Conteúdo </p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2> Conteúdo Secundário</h2>
                <span> conteúdo </span>
    
            </section>
    
            <aside>
                <h2> Conteúdo Complementar</h2>
                <p> Conteúdo</p>
            </aside>

        </div>
    </main>
```
## Baseboard 
The Footer is the bottom part of our website, located at the end it cites "the copyright holder", and can be used to indicate bibliographic sources, texts related to the statements contained in the study, or to refer the reader to other parts of the same text or to other texts. Watch:

### Formatting in Html
**As pictured, this is our footer. This can be done with the tags `` <article> </article>``, ``<footer> </footer> ``. The ARTICLE tag can have its HEADER and FOOTER within this tag**
```
    <article>
        <header> Nossa Empresa </header>

        <div>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corporis quo voluptas fuga laudantium perspiciatis dolore repellat adipisci! Magni sit distinctio, repudiandae cumque magnam totam dolorem at asperiores, corrupti, accusantium aut.
        </div>

        <footer>Carlos Eduardo</footer>
    </article>
```
# Finalization
We end here, **Construction-Html**. Where we learn to build our pages from a blank page to a page with lots of texts, images, audio, etc... With a lot of organization and hierarchy. Thank you for reading all these modules, I hope they help you in some way to understand how to do things in HTML.
