# Improving the Student Table
Now that the table has been created, let's do the same design that is applied in the students' example image.

### Attributes for improvement 
**Starting with CAPTION, our table title, we will use the "STYLE" attribute, to modify its style using:**
- **font-family:** To change your font/letter to Lucida Sans;

**We will use the ``<b>`` tag inside the caption, to make it bold; Leaving the Title like this:**

### Attributes For Table
Going now to our table, we will use some attributes for the **TABLE** tag:
- **border:** We will apply the table border;
- **cellpadding:** Formats the space that the cell will have;
- **cellspacing:** Format the space that the cells will have in relation to the table;
- **width:** It was already mentioned in module 3. To adjust width; In the end, it looked like this:

### Attributes For Header
Now with the table organized, we will change the **Thead**, using the **"style:"** attribute again
- **background-color:** Changes the background color;
- **color:** Changes the color of the letter/font;
- **font-size:** Changes the font size; In the end it looked like this:

# Bônus 
Finally, we can implement more things in this table like footer.

## Bonus Tags 
1. **``<tfoot> </tfoot>``:**Creates the footer of our table; 
2. **``<tr> </tr>``:** collunm;
3. **``<td> </td>``:** line;

**Notice that in the table he created the footer with both spaces correctly. However, it has two blank spaces, to solve it we can use the attribute called "colspan" defining how many columns a specific cell can occupy in the table. It looks like this:**
