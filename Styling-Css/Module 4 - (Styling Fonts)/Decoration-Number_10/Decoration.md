# Colors 
With the image above, we will make the second box red, for this we will use the command ``color:color we want (we can use curentColor and inherith for values ​​that resemble the next one);``:If you don't know how to use the colors or apply other personalized ones, [access here!](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Construction-Html-Css-Javascript/blob/main/Styling-Css/Module%202%20-%20(Appearance)/ColorPalette-Number_04/Pallet.md)

# Alignment
Since we applied the color red to the second box, we will align the text in the first box, with the ``text-align: alignment type`` command, which could be:

- left, start: Begins Left;
- right, end: Ends Right;
- justify: Organize your text;
- center: Centrelize your text;

# Lines
Going now to the lines, being very similar to the borders, we use the command ``text-decoration: border type; ``. [Access here!](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Construction-Html-Css-Javascript/blob/main/Styling-Css/Module%202%20-%20(Appearance)/Bordes-Number_06/Border.md). In addition to having the standard edge types, it also has the following types: wavy, line-through, overline; :

# Space and Height Letters 

## Space
After defining all these attributes, we also have the spacing from one letter to another, using ``letter-spacing: how much space should a letter have`` Let's assign this with the first box having 5px spacing and the second box having 10px spacing. spacing:

## Height 
Furthermore, with the ``line-heigh: size you want` command, we have the size that the line will have. Here in this situation we will apply 30px height to both boxes:

# Standardization 
Finishing the decoration of the texts, we can define by default that each word starts with the first letter capitalized, all with upper and lower case.To use an example, we will create another box similar to the previous two, with differences in standardization and other additional attributes, such as color, decoration, etc.; together, it will have all the words in capital letters. Thanks to the ``text-transform:Text Transformation;`` command. Having the default values:

- captalize: All words begin with first letter in maiuscule;
- uppercase: All words will stay bolder;
- lowercase: All words will stay with default letter;
- normal,none: Default Value;
