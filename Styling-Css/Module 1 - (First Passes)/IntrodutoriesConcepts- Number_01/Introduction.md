# What is CSS?
CSS is called Cascading Style Sheet language and is used to style elements written in a markup language like HTML. CSS separates the content from the visual representation of the website. Think about the decoration of your page. Using CSS it is possible to change the color of the text and background, font and spacing between paragraphs. You can also create tables, use layout variations, adjust images for their respective screens, and so on.

# CSS3 version
Although launched in 2010, CSS3 is the latest version of the Cascading Style Sheet and comes to improve upon previous versions. The best new feature is the flexibility in creating layouts, bringing more autonomy to web designers and developers alike. , which are somehow linked to the site's appearance. With CSS3, it is possible to create rounded corners, shadows, gradient effects, animations and transition effects, among other options.

## CSS1:
Introduced basic style properties for fonts, text, colors, and backgrounds, as well as the concept of selectors to specify which elements should be styled, with support for font properties, text alignment, and backgrounds.

## CSS2:
Expanded layout capabilities with positioning and floating of elements, introduced the display property to control how elements are rendered, added pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements for more specific targeting, support for media types (such as screen and print), and improved internationalization, including bidirectional text support.

## CSS2.1:
Enhanced the CSS2 specification to resolve inconsistencies and ambiguities, standardized box model properties, improving cross-browser compatibility, and introduced CSS3 features such as color properties (e.g., rgba(), hsl()), although not widely implemented at the time. Each version of CSS has improved upon the previous one by introducing new functionality, including rarely used properties that can make development easier and improve the developer experience.

## CSS3:
CSS3 introduced a variety of modules that expanded its capabilities and flexibility. Key features included advanced selectors (like attribute selectors and :nth-child), enhancements to the box model (box-sizing), and typography improvements (such as web fonts with @font-face and text shadows). It also introduced new background and border features, including gradients, multiple background images, and rounded corners with border-radius. CSS3 supported new color formats (rgba(), hsl()) and provided transformation properties for 2D effects. Additionally, it introduced transitions and animations for smooth effects, as well as layout modules like Flexbox, Grid Layout, and Multi-Column Layout. Media queries enabled responsive design, and CSS custom properties (variables) allowed for reusable styling across documents.

## CSS4 (Proposed):
CSS4 represents ongoing work in the CSS Working Group to extend CSS capabilities. Specific modules and features are still in development and may include improvements to existing modules and new features.

## CSS5 (Planned):
CSS5 is not an official specification yet but represents potential future developments in CSS, including further enhancements and capabilities. CSS continues to evolve, and new features and modules are proposed, discussed, and implemented. Developers should keep up with the latest developments in CSS to take full advantage of its capabilities.

### Types of CSS

#### 1. Internal Style
Let's start with the internal style. CSS styles made this way are loaded every time a site is updated, which can increase loading times. Additionally, you will not be able to use the same CSS style on multiple pages as it is contained within a single page. But the advantage of this is that having everything on one page makes it easier to share the model for a preview.

#### 2. External Style
The external method may be the most convenient. Everything is done externally in a .css file. This means you can do all the styling in a separate file and apply the CSS to any page you want. Exterior styling can also improve loading times.

#### 3. Inline Style
Finally, there is also the CSS Inline style. Inline works with specific elements that have the ``<style> </sytle>`` tag. Every component must be styled, so it might not be the best or fastest for dealing with CSS. But it can be useful, for example, to change a single element, quickly preview changes, or if you don't have access to CSS files.

## Historical Summary 
CSS was developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996, for a very simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You should just write the markup for the site.Tags like ``<font> </font>`` were introduced in HTML version 3.2 and caused a lot of problems for developers. Because websites had different fonts, colors, and styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by the W3C to solve this problem.
