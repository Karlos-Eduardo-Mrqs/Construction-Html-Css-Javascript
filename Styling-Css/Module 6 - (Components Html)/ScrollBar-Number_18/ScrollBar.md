# Scrollbar 
Within the css, we can style the scrollbar in the body of our page.

## Example

## -webkit-scrollbar
With this attribute, we can apply styling to the navigation bar, for example, let's apply a blue background:

## -webkit-scrollbar-track
With this attribute, assign a characteristic to the entire path of the navigation bar, similar to webkit-scrollbar.

## -webkit-scrollbar-thumb
Going to this attribute, we can know where we are on the website, for example:

In the navigation bar, we have three parts. In the first, we have the up and down arrows, to go up and down. In the second, there is the navigation bar (light gray) and finally the white background, the navigation limit part. Going back to -webkit-scrollbar-thumb, we can set the part to light gray, for example a dark gray background and 15px rounding:

## ::-webkit-scrollbar-button
Here we can apply the up and down buttons, for example earthy colored and rounded buttons:
