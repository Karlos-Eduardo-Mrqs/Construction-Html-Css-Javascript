# Standardization in CSS
Known as Reset.CSS, or CSS reset, it is a technique or set of CSS styles designed to normalize the default styling of HTML elements across all web browsers.The goal is to create a consistent and predictable foundation for web development, regardless of standard style variations between different browsers.

# How is it interpreted by browsers?
Each browser has its own presentation by default and this individual behavior can generate layout conflicts in your web project.This was a very common problem, faced by Front-end programmers. Despite being a *simple technique*, reaching a consensus minimum on how to “force” all browsers to have the same behavior, it was not easy.

## How to use ?
We already know that it is a style sheet and that we can use it as we normally do in a web project, either within the HTML file or in an external file (which can be accessed by all other files); is that before starting to style the project, the reset CSS file is already added so that the original formatting of the browsers can be removed.

This is because, if the CSS reset is added in the middle of the project, for example, it can cause headaches since the layout was created using browser formatting as a reference and not the standardization of the elements that were reset.
