## Practice with Switch
We will perform user recognition, through the switch, we will present the user with a welcome committee, for the program to recognize the user, we will have three passwords, one for the teacher, one for the student and one for the administrator and at the end, we will have four conditions:

1. If the password is "Admin478": The program will alert you that you are an administrator;
2. If the password is "Profe564": The program will alert you that you are a teacher;
3. If the password is "Aluno231": The program will alert you that you are a student;
4. If you do not have any of these passwords: The program will alert you that you do not have a password and you will have to contact support;

### Html file
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
### Javascript file 
We will present the user, an alert ("Welcome") . Then the system will ask for the password, to recognize the user. Then, using the password, we will identify your hierarchy (Admin, Teacher and Student);
