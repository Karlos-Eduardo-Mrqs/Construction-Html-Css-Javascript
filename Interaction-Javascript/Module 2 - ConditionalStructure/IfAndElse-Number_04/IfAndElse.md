# Control Structures
Conditional structures are resources offered by languages ​​so that it is possible to check a condition and change the algorithm's execution flow. Thus, it is possible to define a specific action for different scenarios and obtain exactly the expected result during the development of a website or application.

# Why is it necessary to use conditionals?
The use of conditional structures is practically indispensable in most projects, as they are capable of performing different functions in a practical way. They allow, for example, controlling the content that will be displayed, creating dynamic forms, developing interactive media and making pages responsive.

## Conditional Structure If, ​​Else If and Else

- **If:** You can use IF in JavaScript to specify code that should be executed immediately after the condition returns true.

- **If/Else:** Specifying a block of code to be executed if the condition is true.

## Practices with the If Structure
We will use an html file for the user to interact, we will do the following, the user will enter two notes and see the average, if the average is less than 6, it will warn that the average was below, otherwise, the average was above.

### Html file

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Javascript file 
Let's use a function called prompt() . This function causes a terminal-like prompt to appear. Note:

We will do this twice, for the first note and the second note. At the end there will be an alert, saying the student's total average. For the alert, we will have to use the alert() function, which will have a warning on the screen. This notice will be presented at the beginning of the Final Result.
