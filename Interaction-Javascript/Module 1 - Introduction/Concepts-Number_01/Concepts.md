# Front - End
Now, we finally come to Javascript, the interaction of our websites. Where with it, we can work together with Html and Css. All three of these technologies are used to make the Front-End, that is, the front part. It can be represented by this image:

## Structures Of Front - End

- **Structure (Skeleton):** The skeleton is the structure of our muscular mass, just as HTML is the structure/construction of all our content within the pages;

- **Coloration (Clothes and others):** Clothes, our eyes, limb size and other measurements of body size and characteristics. They are our "painting", just as css is the coloring inside the pages;

- **Interaction (Brain):** Our brain, internal organs, blood vessels and the like. They are responsible for our ability to think, interact, communicate and "protect". Having the same function as Javascript on our pages;

# Html implementation
Javascript can be implemented by Html internally or externally. Similar to Css, we can do it in the following ways...

## Internal
To implement Javascript internally in HMTL, you have to use the ``script`` tag for HTML to interpret the language:

**You can add it to either the body or the head, as you prefer.**

## External
In the external part, using the same tag mentioned above, it is possible to add an attribute called src, for those who did Construction-Html and Styling-Css, you know what this is about. Remembering, this attribute is used for anchors or for imports from other files:

# Bonus

To get started with Javascript, let's destroy a curse called Hello World!. As the legend goes, whoever doesn't make the first program saying Hello World!, won't be a successful programmer. To do this is simple, just type the command ``console.log("Hello, World!");``, so that the console receives this message. View it using the shortcut CTRL+⬆️+I:

If you want it to appear on the screen, use the command alert("Hello, World!"). Where alert, a message on the screen:

# Bônus 2 
Did you know that there is a way for you to run your Javascript commands in the VsCode terminal? No ?!? So, follow this step by step to run your codes through the console:

# 1. Node.js Installation
Immediately, we need Node.js, go to the website [node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt) and install it. Attention, just follow the installation instructions, do not modify anything. At the end, this screen will be shown here:

# 2. VsCode Installation
Then, if you don't have Visual Studio Code, access the website [Visual Studio Code.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Type the "node" command, thus executing Javascript commands. Follow the installation instructions and let's move on:

# 3. Additional Extensions
Now with VsCode installed, we will have to install programming language extensions, for example (Javascript, Python, C#, C++ and among others), helpers being used to help you debug these codes in the terminal, code.runner.
