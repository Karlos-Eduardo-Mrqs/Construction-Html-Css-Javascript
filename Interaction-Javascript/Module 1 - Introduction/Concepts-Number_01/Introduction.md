# What is Javascript?
Javascript is a lightweight programming language that developers use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, games, etc. It creates elements to improve website visitors' interaction with web pages, such as drop-down menus, animated graphics, and dynamic background cores. However, it still maintains user interaction, something CSS cannot do alone.

# Characteristics
JavaScript, as its name suggests, is a scripting language. A scripting language is commonly defined as a programming language that allows the programmer to control one or more third-party applications. In the case of JavaScript, we can control some browser behaviors through snippets of code that are sent in the HTML page. Another common characteristic in scripting languages ​​is that they are normally interpreted languages, that is, they do not depend on compilation to be executed.

# Historical Summary
Aiming at the potential of the Internet for the general public and the need for greater user interaction with pages, Netscape, creator of the most popular browser of the early 90s, with the same name, created Livescript, a simple language that allowed the execution of scripts contained in pages within the 
browser itself.

Taking advantage of the imminent success of the Java language, which was gaining more and more space in the corporate application development market, Netscape soon renamed Livescript as JavaScript in an agreement with Sun to leverage the use of both. The then vice-leader of browsers, Microsoft, added support for scripts written in VBScript to Internet Explorer and created its own version of JavaScript, JScript.

## Java X Javascript
**1. Language model:** While Java is an OOP programming language, JavaScript manifests itself as a strictly scripting language – also of the OOP type.

**2. The code:** While the code used in the Java language requires compilation, the code used in the JavaScript platform is attributed in text form in its entirety.

**3. A Machine:** JavaScript, within its scenario, is known to only run in a browser, while Java's range of options is much greater. In addition to the browser, Java also runs on any and all virtual machines.

**4. Language features:** The Java language was designed, from its inception, as a language model aimed mainly at objects, while JavaScript does not have a pure and simple definition of classes.

**5. Simplicity:** It is exactly in this context that Java and JavaScript differ the most, since the second is considered much simpler by the large mass of experts involved in the issue. Because it uses objects created in the body of HTML, JavaScript is easier to use, the opposite of Java – where in-depth knowledge of the classes it comprises is necessary.

# Conclusion 
In short, these two elements of the development and technology area relate to the same purpose, although certain differences are easy to observe. The so-called programming language is the north of these two pieces that, on the one hand, are considered to be part of the same family and, on the other, are considered completely different.
