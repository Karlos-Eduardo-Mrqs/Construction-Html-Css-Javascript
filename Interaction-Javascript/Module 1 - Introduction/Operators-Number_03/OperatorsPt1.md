# Operators
Operators are essential elements in the JavaScript programming language. They allow diverse operations, from simple mathematical calculations to complex data manipulations. In this article, we'll explore operators in JavaScript and discover how they can power your code.

## Types of Operators
In programming languages ​​we have three types, namely, Arithmetic, Logical and Comparison.

### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are types of operators used in mathematical operations.

#### Representing Mathematical Form 
1. Sum = 10 + 5;
2. Subtraction = 10 - 5;
3. Multiplication = 10 * 5;
4. Split = 10/5;
5. Exponential = 10^5 or 10 * 10 *10 * 10 * 10;
6. Remainder of Division = (10/5 = 2) and remainder of division 0;
7. Increment = 10 + 1;
8. Decrement = 5 - 1;

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to set values ​​to variables. The main one being (the = symbol). Additionally, we can make a reservation for Arithmetic Operators.

#### Representing Mathematical Form
1. Sum = 20 + 5;
2. Subtraction = 20 - 5;
3. Multiplication = 20 * 5;
4. Split = 20/5;
5. Remainder of Division = 20/5 = 4 and remainder of division 0;

# Observation 
The subtraction operator - ,can have a negative value. For example, 8 - 16 = -8. The operator Modulo(Remainder Of Division) % , if you were in doubt, see the image below:

The Quotient is the result of the division operator and the remainder is the result of the modulus. For example, 10/5 = 2, but the remainder of your division is 0 .
