# Variables 
Variable is the name used to define one or more values ​​that are manipulated by programs during their operation. The name “variable” is used because it is a type of content that can present different values ​​while the system is running. Everything will depend on the user's command and the type of operation that is performed.

## Rules for Creating Variables

### 1. A variable is case-sensitive
This means that names with uppercase letters are different from names with lowercase letters: for a JavaScript program, Name is different from name.

### 2. Valid characters

- Words:
Although most browsers already recognize a variety of UTF-8 characters (such as words with accents and "ಠ_ಠ", for example), it is recommended to use only UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, without accents and spaces.

- Numbers:
As long as they are preceded by one or more letters.

- Underline and dollar sign:
"_" and "$" are also allowed in any position, but are rarely used.

### Variable Types 

#### 1. Variable
The types of variables that change their value during programming;

- Variable Syntax

```
var or let variable name = variable value; 
var age = 15; 
let age = 19;
```

#### 2. Constant 
The types of variables that do not change their value during programming;

- Constant Syntax
```
const variable name = variable value;
const Cpf= "155.688.997-77"
```

#### 3. Array
More robustly, an array is a data structure that serves to store elements in a memory space. 
These memory spaces are called variables. In the JavaScript course you learn everything about arrays, variables, types and much more.

- Array Sintax
``` 
let, var ou const nome do array = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
let frutas = ["Limão","Banana","Maçã","Uva","Laranja","Tomate","Manga","Maracuja","Morango","Melancia"];
```

#### 4. Object
Type of data/variable that functions as an independent entity, in which there is a set of attributes nested within a variable.

- Object Syntax
```
var, let or const variable name = {attribute1:value,attribute2:value,attribute3:value,attribute4:value}
```
