# Objects In Javascript 
Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, where the key is a string (or symbol) that identifies the property, and the value can be any data type, including other objects. Objects allow you to organize complex data and represent real-world entities with attributes and behaviors.

## Manually Form For Create Objects
Creating objects in JavaScript can be done in several ways, each offering different features and use cases. Here’s an overview of the most common methods for creating objects.

- **Literal Object:** Object literals are one of the most commonly used data structures in JavaScript. They are used to store collections of data, and can be used to represent complex data structures such as objects, arrays, functions, and even regular expressions.

- **Using Word new Object():** To create an object, you use the new keyword, followed by the constructor function of the object you want to create. For example, to create an instance of the Person object defined above, you would use the following code:

- **Construct Functions:** A constructor function in JavaScript is simply a function that is used to create instances of objects. When you call a constructor function with the new operator, it creates a new object and binds this to that new object.

## Manually Form For Access And Modify Objects
