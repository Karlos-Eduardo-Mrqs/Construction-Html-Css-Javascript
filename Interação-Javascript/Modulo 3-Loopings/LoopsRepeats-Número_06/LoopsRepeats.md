# What are Loopings?
Looping is a term used in programming to describe the repetition of a set of instructions or actions. It is a fundamental structure in many programming languages ​​and is widely used to 
automate tasks and control the flow of a program. 
## Looping Example
Let's consider the case of a farmer who wants to make sure he has enough food to feed his family for the week. He can use the following loop to achieve this:

## Types of Loopings 
In total, we have three types of loopings with their formats and each one with its specific characteristics and purposes.
## 1. Repetition with tests at the beginning;
### Looping for 
It is a repetition structure that allows you to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It is especially useful when you know exactly how many times the code needs to be repeated. The for loop is made up of three main parts: 
- Initialization (the initial repetition counter);
- The continuation condition (how many times this repetition will occur);
- The update (Being the increment++ or the decrement--).

### Looping foreach
For each looping is used to loop through a collection of elements, such as an array or list, and execute a block of code for each element. It is especially useful when you want to perform an action for each item in a collection. Having the same configuration as for.

## 2. Repetição com testes no fim
### Looping Do-While
Do-while looping is similar to while looping, but the condition is checked after each iteration of the loop. This means that the code block will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false from the beginning.

## 3. Repetition with control variable
### Looping While
It is a repetition structure that executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It is useful when you don't know exactly how many times the code needs to be repeated, but rather until a condition is met. The condition is checked before each loop iteration.
